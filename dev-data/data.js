                However, the sentiment remained positive for the short term as the index closed above the crucial resistance level of 22,200, with the next resistance seen at 22,400. 
                 Short-term support is positioned at 21,900. As long as Nifty maintains levels above 21,900, the index may continue to be considered a buy on dips.
                 
                The Bank Nifty index maintained its robust momentum, breaking past the 46,500 level, which is now established as a formidable support. 
                Any retracement towards this support zone presents an ideal opportunity to initiate long positions, targeting an upside of 48,000. 
                The immediate hurdle for the index is situated at 47,100, and a conclusive break above this level would signify a resumption of the uptrend toward the mentioned targets of 48,000.

        "body": `State-run Indian banks saw a significant uptick in today's trading session, leading up to the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy announcement on February 8, where the RBI is expected to maintain the status quo for the sixth time in a row.
                 According to Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda, there is a very high likelihood that the repo rate will remain unchanged again.
                 "Repo cut unlikely; a probable change in liquidity stance. RBI was clear that repo cuts were out of the picture unless headline inflation came down and sustainably remained at the 4% target. Hence, given the current CPI level, the possibility of a rate cut has been ruled out," said Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.
                 In its December meeting, the RBI made a unanimous decision to maintain the policy repo rate at 6.5%. This rate has been consistently held at 6.5% since February 2023. On the other hand, the yield on the 10-year Indian government bond dropped in Wednesday's trading session to 7.0780% from Tuesday's close of 7.0920%, as per the Trading Economics data.
                 Central Bank of India stock also ended today's session with a notable uptick of 11.4%, settling at ₹74.15 apiece. Canara Bank shares surged nearly 6% on the bank's proposal to consider a split of its equity share.Other PSU bank stocks such as Punjab & Sind Bank, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, and Indian Bank all finished today's session with gains between 0.1% and 3.7%.`

                    Here, we list out the top performing flexi cap mutual fund schemes based on their annualised returns in the past five years. Before proceeding ahead, let us first understand what exactly are flexi cap mutual funds.
                    These refer to the mutual fund schemes which enjoy the flexibility of investing in stocks of companies across the market capitalisation i.e. small cap, mid cap and large cap. However, there should be a minimum investment of 65 percent in equity & equity-related instruments. There are a total of 38 mutual fund schemes in this category with total assets under management (AUM) of ₹3.27 lakh crore, shows the AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) data as on Dec 31, 2023.
                    
                    As the table above shows, three mutual fund schemes delivered over 20 percent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) return in the past five years. These are Quant Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund and JM Flexicap Fund. The lowest five-year annualised return, the table shows, was given by Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.
